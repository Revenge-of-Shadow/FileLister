This program reads from the current POSIX directory and writes the list of files to "list.txt".
It could have had reading from the launch arguments, but they result in segmentation faults.
It can also be hardcoded to read only the files of a specific extension.

Unfortunately, I do not plan to make this program better. I need a utility and I need it fast.
